## 💡 Innovation Highlights

### 1. **Memorable Naming Convention**
Instead of generic names like "ValidationService" or "SafetyChecker", uses themed Chuck references:
- Makes modules memorable
- Shows personality and creativity
- Demonstrates communication skills
- Tech is still serious and production-ready

### 2. **Configuration-Driven Validation**
All validation rules in JSON - no code changes needed:
- Easy to adapt to different industries
- Non-engineers can modify rules
- A/B testing friendly
- Compliance team can maintain

### 3. **Quarantine System ("Stay In The Car")**
Novel approach between approve/reject:
- Suspicious outputs held for human review
- Prevents false positives from blocking work
- Audit trail for borderline cases
- Configurable suspicion thresholds

### 4. **Safe Mode with Manual Override ("Buy More Cover")**
Automatic safety shutdown with authorization requirement:
- Prevents AI runaway scenarios
- Requires deliberate reactivation
- Protects against cascading failures
- Production safety-first mindset

### 5. **Multi-Language Implementation**
Both C++ (Unreal Engine) and Python:
- Shows versatility
- Reaches different industries (gaming vs ML/data science)
- Demonstrates language expertise
- Pip-installable Python package
